Some people may wonder why there aren't any updates on my projects during the last few weeks. Well, a few things changed in my life and that's why I don't have a lot of time or motivation. So I decided to make a complete break for this summer until September.<!--more-->

I will monitor and maintain all running services (public servers, ...), of course.

See you later :P
