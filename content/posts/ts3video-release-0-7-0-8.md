Most changes are internal and don’t change the user experience,

# Troubleshooting

Some users might have problems with a _missing DLL._ Well, that’s my fault.
I forgot to put _vc\_redist.x64.exe_ into the Installer’s package.
You can download it from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
or wait for v0.7, which I will release this evening.

## Update 2016-05-06

I’ve created a new Client Installer v0.7, which includes the missing
_vc\_redist.x64.exe_ and installs required system DLLs.
