I decided to update my website to be completely static. You may wonder why and whether it makes more efford.
Well, the content of the site doesn't change that often and is mostly static anyway.

Since I don't update my website very often, only write posts for special events.
PHP requires interpretation with every request, even if nothing changed. Security blah blubb.
